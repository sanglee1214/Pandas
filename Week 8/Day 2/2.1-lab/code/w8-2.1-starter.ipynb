    "So although the basic idea of Bayesian regressions is not much different from what you saw when doing linear regressions. There will be a major difference in how they are implemented in code. Whereas one simply pushed in columns of data and a target into a regression to get output, the actual \"specification\" of the model is a bit more involved in the Bayesian variety. In particular, you will have to specify priors, likelihoods etc. However, fear not, we are not going to write any of these posterior distributions and their associated ingredients manually. We're going to introduce a dedicated software packages this week, PyStan, that not only gives you leverage in the specification side, but includes a whole lot of really efficient C++ code to do the parameter estimation. Unlike what you did earlier in the week, we won't use MLE to estimate the parameters utilizing the Monte-Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC). \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Getting back to our previous discussion, the difference between classical and Bayesian regression can be thought of as thus: \n",
    "-   Classical regression is a special case of the Bayesian perspective whereby we have a non-informative prior. \n",
    "\n",
    "I'm sure you recall what 'non-informative' refers to uniform priors (i.e. no prior information assumed to bias things one way or another). \n",
    "\n",
    "The Bayesian approach also relaxes a few assumptions, we no longer have to assume homoscedasticity etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "(Just in case you need to review this homoskedasticity: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRklTsY9w9c).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can remember what it means by just breaking the word down to it's component parts - homo : same, skedastic : variation, the later word can be thought of as being related to \"skew\" i.e. how much your line \"skews\" from the \"true\" trend-line.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as previously stated, the Bayesian approach is fundamentally the \"inverse\" trick (i.e f(X|$\\theta$) to f($\\theta$|X)), and is primarily concerned with estimating parameters. In the case of Regressions, estimating $\\beta$'s and estimating $\\sigma$'s (and thus $\\sigma^2$'s).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does this matter? Bayesian regressions give you, the modeler/data scientist a lot more control over your model. You can specify priors for each of the parameters in your regression (the $\\beta$'s), the error term, and even the constant (as well as the target). Therefore, it's worth to learn, and will give you more latitude to fit your model to the data you \n",
    "\n",
    "So we know that the joint of $\\beta$ and $\\sigma^2$ is proportional to the precision, defined as $\\frac{1}{\\sigma^2}$. Further, $$p(\\beta, \\sigma^2|{y}) = p(\\beta|{y}, \\sigma^2)p(\\sigma^2|{y})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned previously, we have check that this is not a pathological probability (proper) blah blah, but this ins't a mathematics course, so we'll again be blissfully ignorant of these complexities. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we had a procedural step-wise perspective of the procedure, here's what it would be: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Determine $\\beta$, $\\sigma$ using posterior distributions\n",
    "2. Construct $y_{i+1}, y_{i+2}, ... y_{i+n}$ from a distribution using the parameters from step 1"
